Cluster-Map Instrunction
========================

0. ClusterMap is based on one example program in the prefuse.
   (http://prefuse.org/)


1. ClusterMap reads cluster data from 'cdb_tree.xml' file.
 - The xml file can be created using 'cdb_tree' function in 'bitshred.py'.


2. To run the program,
    $ java -Xms32m -Xmx1024m -cp prefuse.jar:ClusterMap.jar ClusterMap

  * -Xmx option is for setting maximum memory in case of big cluster data set.


3. On cluster map,
 - Each bright grey rectangle shows a malware family; 
   and each dark grey rectangle represents a malware sample.
 - When mouse is over a malware sample; corresponding file name and (ClamAV) label 
   are displayed at bottom left side.
 - At bottom right side, we have search box, which allows us to find and highlight
   malware samples using file name or (ClamaV) label.
