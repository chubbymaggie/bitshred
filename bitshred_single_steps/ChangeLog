0.9 (2012.08.08)
----------------
Changed options:
 - '-u/--update' changed to '-b/--binary'
 - '-i/--input' changed to '-t/--text'
 - '-t/--threshold' changed to '-j/--jaccard'
Changed bitshred_t struct
Changed input format:
 - '-b' and '-t' take as an input a file path


0.81 (2012.05.02)
----------------
Modified -i option:
 - prints a progress and safely ignores small size of files


0.8 (2012.04.28)
----------------
Added -i option:
 - takes text files as inputs


0.7 (2012.04.11)
----------------
Added quality.py script:
 - to measure precision/recall


0.6 (2012.03.26)
----------------
Changed the Jaccard calculation:
 - skipped counting setbits when bitwise-AND results in zero
Changed the update routine:
 - a file is not inserted into DB if a fingerprint is too dense


0.5 (2011.11.04)
----------------
Small fixes


0.4 (2011.05.11)
----------------
Changed the Jaccard calculation:
 - pre-computed S(f_a) and S(f_b) at fingerprint generation
 - performed bit-wise AND operation to calculate S(f_a \wedge f_b)
 - calculated S(f_a \vee f_b) = S(f_a) + S(f_b) - S(f_a \wedge f_b)
 - overall, removed bit-wise OR operation
 - achieved significant performance improvement
Changed the record structure of Berkeley DB
 - added a field: nbits


0.3 ()
