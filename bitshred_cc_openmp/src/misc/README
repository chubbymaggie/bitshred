BitShred-Coclustering-OpenMP Misc
=================================

1. To visualize the co-clustering results:
 $ ./visual -g w,x,y,z
           [-d <db_path> -n]

 *[] denotes optional parameters

 -Input (comma-separated):
  w: outer iteration number
  x: inner iteration number
  y: # of row groups
  z: # of column groups
 -Output:
  matrix.p       : gnuplot setup file
  matrixXXXXX.dat: gnuplot data file for dots
  splitline.dat  : gnuplot data file for splitting lines

 *Note1:
  -n option is used when visualizing the co-clustering results w/ '.new' suffix

 *Note2:
  'iter_split.log' file is expected to have the splitting points between iterations,
  which is generated by running 'merge.c'


2. To merge two co-clustering results:
  (This is supposed to be used to merge two dominant groups from two iterations.)
 $ ./merge  <db_path_a> <param_a> <db_path_b> <param_b>

 -Input:
  db_path_a : the db path containing the first co-clustering result
  param_a   : (comma-separated) w,x,y,z for the first co-clustering result
  db_path_b : the db path containing the second co-clustering result
  param_b   : (comma-separated) w,x,y,z for the second co-clustering result
 -Output:
  db.new/adjlist/dataX        : the new merged adjacent lists
  db.new/global/r_w_x_y_z.new : the new merged global R
  db.new/global/c_w_x_y_z.new : the new merged global C
  iter_split.log              : the splitting points between iterations
