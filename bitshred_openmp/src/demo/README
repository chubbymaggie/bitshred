End-to-end system Demo Instruction
==================================

0. First, we need to preapre a log file. 
 - For reference, there is 'sample.log' file in the same directory.
 - Each line of log file should be in the following format:
   'malware-file-path:virus-name:packer-name:'

 * The reason we use log file is that we want to construct virus fingerprint
   DB including other information such as virus name and packer name.


1. To run the demo,
    $ ./bitshred.py  log-file  #-of-samples  clustering-threshold

  - log-file: path for log file metioned in 0.
  - #-of-samples: the total number of samples we want to put into DB.
         If this is '-1', BitShred will process whole list in the log file.
  - clustering-threshold: 0 ~ 1 value


2. BitShred will update DB, compare samples in DB, cluster samples in DB, and then
   show a clustering graph at the end of the demo.

  - If we want to see clustering graphs with different threshold value 
    without updaing new malware samples:
     $ ./bitshred.py  -  -  clustering-threshold
