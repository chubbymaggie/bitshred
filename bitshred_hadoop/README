BitShred-Hadoop Instruction
===========================

0. Most of the parameters are hard-coded in source code.
 * Gen.java:
  - SAMPLE_PATH: path to malware sample in HDFS
  - SHRED_SIZE: size of a shred
  - BF_SIZE: size of a fingerprint (in bytes)
  - DATA_PATH: path to fingerprints in HDFS
  - BF_PER_FILE: number of fingerprints per a file
  - windowSize: size of a window (Winnowing)

 * Cmp.java:
  - BF_SIZE: size of a fingerprint (in bytes)
  - BF_PER_FILE: number of fingerprints per a file
  - numBF: total number of fingerprints (or samples)


1. To divide generating/comparing jobs to several map tasks:
   (ex) $ ./input.py logfile 655360 2048 4


2. To generate fingerprints for malware samples:
  - 'input-gen' (created at step 1) needs to be copied to HDFS.
  - 'run_gen.sh' script is included for a reference.
  - 'Gen.jar' generates fingerprints for malware samples located at SAMPLE_PATH
    into DATA_PATH.


3. To compare fingerprints:
  - 'input-cmp' (created at step 1) needs to be copied to HDFS.
  - 'run_cmp.sh' script is included for a reference.
  - 'Cmp.jar' compares fingerpints located at DATA_PATH and
    produces a list of similarity values.
