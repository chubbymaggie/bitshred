----------------
Changed the Jaccard calculation:
 - pre-computed S(f_a) and S(f_b) at fingerprint generation
 - performed bit-wise AND operation to calculate S(f_a \wedge f_b)
 - calculated S(f_a \vee f_b) = S(f_a) + S(f_b) - S(f_a \wedge f_b)
 - overall, removed bit-wise OR operation
 - achieved significant performance improvement
Changed the algorithm for counting set bits in a bitvector
 - achieved performnace improvement at the Jaccard calculation
Changed byte array to int array to store fingerprints
 - byte-based fingerprints from HDFS are converted into int-based fingerprints in memory
 - brought speed-up at couting set bits, which works on 32-bit integer
Divided jobs at each MAP node into smaller blocks
 - better cache utilization
Removed the use of DistributedCache
 - reduced disk access overhead at start-up
 - each MAP node needs to access a related subset of entire fingerprint files
